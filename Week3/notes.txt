1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
   In this project, I used standard input and output. Both the standard input and output functionalities are available
   in the libraries used.The `stdarray` library provides functions for creating lists. To create a 1D list, I uesed the
   function `stdarray.create1D()`, and to create a 2D list, I used the function `stdarray.create2D()`. Each of these
   functions accepts parameters that specify the size of each dimension. Additionally, these functions can take an
   optional argument to initialize each element of the lists.  In the `stdio` library, there are functions for reading
    standard inputs. For instance, `readInt()` reads input as an integer, `readFloat()` reads input as a float,
    `readString()` reads input as strings, and `readAllStrings()` reads all remaining inputs as a list of strings.
    Also writeln() and write() are functions that write standard output. Furthermore, the 'stdaudio' library provides
    capabilities for playing digital sound.
     Also there are another way of accepting standard input. By using operators in the terminal, the program can interact
    with another program, read from a file of standard input, and write the result into a file of standard output.
