1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
   The main() function is usually invoked when the script is run directly as the main program. The classes in this
   project are used to define constructors, instance variables, and method. Instance variables are attributes specific
   to each instance of a class. They store unique information for each object, and you can find them using a dot,
   like object.attribute. Instance variables are defined within the class but outside of any method and are typically
   initialized in the constructor (`__init__` method) using the `self` keyword. Methods are functions defined within a
   class that operate on the object's data such as blob_finder.getBeads(). These methods use a special parameter called
   `self` to refer to the current object. It helps methods talk to the object it's working with.
