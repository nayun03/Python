1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
   This project involves if statements, for loops, and while loops are used. If statements are conditional statements
   that execute only if the expression is true. If statements can be extended with elif and else statements to execute
   additional code. While loops repeat statements as long as the expression is true. On the other hand, for loops repeat
   statements when variables are in a collection of objects. In the collection of objects, range is commonly used to let
   variable work in the range. These loops make it easy to repeat actions without rewriting the same code. Additionally,
   break statements provide a way to exit loops if a certain condition is met and can be used with if statements, for
   loops, and while loops.
