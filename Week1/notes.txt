1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
Creating programs takes inputs, calculates them, and shows outputs. Commonly used tools include the `math`, 'stdrandom',
 `sys`, and `stdio` libraries from Python's standard libraries. `sys.argv` receives input values, which can be assigned
 to data types such as floats or integers. The programs in Project1 handle inputs as floats, integers, and strings.
 The `math` library offers various arithmetic operations. After appropriately assigning input values to data types,
 the programs perform calculations using these operators. 'stdrandom' typically refers to a module or library that
 provides functionality for generating random numbers. For example, 'uniformInt' returns a integer randomly chosen from the interval.
  Finally, results are displayed using `stdio.writeln` or `stdio.write`. The distinction
 between these methods is that `writeln` adds a newline after standard output, while `write` does not.All programs in
 this project allow users to enter data, perform calculations, and view the results effectively.
