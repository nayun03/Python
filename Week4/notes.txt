1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
   Functions are defined with `def', which specifies the function name and parameters in parentheses. These parameters
   are placeholders for values to be passed when the function is called. Within the body of a function, operations are
   performed on these parameters and results are returned with `return'. Functions are called by their names, followed
   by parentheses containing arguments. Variables within functions are local, while those in the global scope can be
   accessed. Functions can call other functions, promoting code reusability and simplifying code organization, reading,
   and maintenance. When a program is imported as a library, the program's `__name__` attribute is not set to
   `'__main__'`. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` construct allows code to run only when a script is directly executed.
   When a program is imported into another program, the functions that belong to the program, that is, the application
   programming interface (API), can be used by <library name>.<function name>.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
